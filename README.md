## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16
- NPM or Yarn
- For iOS: Xcode, CocoaPods
- For Android: Android Studio, JDK

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# For iOS, install pods
npx pod-install ios
```

## Running the App

### iOS
```bash
npm run ios
```

### Android
```bash
npm run android
```

### Web
```bash
npm run web
```

## Required Permissions

This app requires microphone permissions to function properly:

- iOS: Microphone access
- Android: Record Audio permission

## How it Works

The app uses React Native Voice for speech recognition, which interfaces with the native speech recognition capabilities of iOS and Android. For web, it uses the Web Speech API.

Transcripts are saved locally using AsyncStorage and can be viewed in the app's history section.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- React Native Voice
- React Native Paper (UI components)
- AsyncStorage (for local storage)
- React Native Permissions
- Vosk speech-to-text (Android offline)
- Kotlin native module bridge
- Webpack + React-Native-Web

## Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/` | Shared JS/TS components and business logic |
| `src/components/*.(js \| web.js \| android.js)` | Platform-split UI and wrappers |
| `android/` | Native Android code (Kotlin Vosk recogniser) |
| `ios/` | iOS project (placeholder) |
| `public/` | Web entry (`index.html`) served by webpack-dev-server |

## Roadmap / Nice-to-have

- üîà Speaker diarisation (who said what?)
- üåê Automatic language detection
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud sync (Supabase / Firebase) so transcripts follow you across devices
- üìÑ Export to PDF / DOCX
- üìä Analytics dashboard (talk-time per speaker, word clouds)
- üñ•Ô∏è PWA packaging for installable web experience
- ‚ú® Whisper on-device support once released for RN (iOS & Android)
